# LogisticRegression

Logistic regression is the statistical technique used to predict the relationship between predictors (our independent variables) and a predicted variable (the dependent variable) where the dependent variable is a binary variable that contains data coded as 1 (yes, success, etc.) or 0 (no, failure, etc.).

This is an example of Binary Logistic Regression. The dataset we are using for this analysis can be found here -> https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance#. This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por).

To make the model accuracy better we performed standardization and hyperparameter tuning.
